## Learning Objectives

* Understand the difference between one-, two- and n-dimensional arrays in NumPy;

* Understand how to apply some linear algebra operations to n-dimensional arrays without using for-loops;

* Understand axis and shape properties for n-dimensional arrays.

## Context

Here, we manipulate Numpy arrays to perform linear algebra operations in an optimized manner in order to generate a compressed approximation of an image.
