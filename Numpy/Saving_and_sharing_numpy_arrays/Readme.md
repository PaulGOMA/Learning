## Learning Objectives

* Create two 1D arrays and one 2D array

* Save these arrays to files

* Remove variables from workspace

* Load the variables from saved file

* Compare zipped binary files to human-readable delimited files


## Context

Here, we save NumPy arrays as zipped files and human-readable comma-delimited files i.e. *.csv. we also learn to load both of these file types back into NumPy workspaces.

## Prerequisites

* [**Python**](https://www.python.org/)
* [**Numpy**](https://numpy.org/)
